mythic_notify- https://github.com/JayMontana36/mythic_notify

I use https://forum.cfx.re/t/the-diamond-casino-heist-arcade-interiors/917315 for my arcade interior where Madam Nazar is located. If you use a different one or Madam Nazar is located elsewhere in your server, simply locate the coordinates of your Madam Nazar and replace the coodinates in the config.lua file.
